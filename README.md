# Numerical Physics Simulations in Python

This repository contains a collection of physics-based simulations developed in Python, focusing on classical mechanics and numerical methods.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to model real physical systems using computational techniques and to better understand motion through mathematical simulation.

All models were implemented from scratch and explore how numerical algorithms can approximate real-world physics.

## Implemented Simulations

### Projectile Motion
- Simulation of ballistic trajectories
- Analysis of launch angle and velocity
- Extended model including air resistance

### Aerodynamic Drag
- Modeling the effect of drag force on moving bodies
- Comparison between ideal and non-ideal motion

### Numerical Integration Methods
Implemented and compared major physics solvers:

- Euler Method — simple numerical integration  
- Verlet Method — higher stability for dynamic systems  

These methods were used to simulate motion and evaluate accuracy.

### Kinematic Motion Models
- Constant acceleration systems  
- Braking motion simulation  
- Position and velocity tracking over time  

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Scientific programming in Python  
- Mathematical modeling  
- Numerical methods  
- Physics-based problem solving  
- Algorithmic thinking  

## Why This Project Matters

Understanding physics through simulation is essential in aerospace and mechanical engineering.

This project reflects my strong interest in applying mathematics and programming to analyze real-world systems.
